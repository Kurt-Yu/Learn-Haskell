# Learn-Haskell

This is the repository for me to learn the Haskell programming language. 

The first folder is the source code of the book [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters).

The second folder is my solution to [Ninety Nine Haskell Problems](https://wiki.haskell.org/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems).
